	This is a Python program for sending mass texts and/or photos to someone's phone using SMTP.  Although this program's 
intention is for that purpose, one can easily use it with actual email addresses.  Since this program is utilizing SMTP to send out 
texts/photos an sms/mms gateway is needed.  For example: phonenumber@txt.att.net/phonenumber@mms.att.net.  
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_SMS_gateways for more examples.
